I'm exited to announce the release of **Feeds Fun version 1.12**!

This update brings a lot of cool features and improvements.

**Important:** Due to significant changes, all user settings have been reset, including API keys. Please check and update your settings.

## What's New

### Improved collections interface and logic

- You can now subscribe to individual feeds from a collection or the entire collection.
- Feeds from collections are marked in your feed list for easy recognition.
- Each feed in a collection comes with a detailed description.
- Best of all, **all feeds in collections are tagged for free for all users!**

I've removed the old collections (gamedev, artificial intelligence) because they didn't meet the new quality standards. From now on, I'll be putting more care into creating collections.

**The first new collecton contains all scientific papers from arXiv!** From now, you can always stay up to date with the latest scientific research!

### Gemini API Support

I've added support for the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/), Google's alternative to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Now you can use Gemini for tagging in addition to ChatGPT. This is especially exciting because Gemini offers a free tier with a limited number of requests, so you can test all the features of Feeds Fun without any extra cost.

You can set your OpenAI or Gemini API key in the settings section of the Feeds Fun website.

If you're self-hosting Feeds Fun, please see the additional notes in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Tiendil/feeds.fun/blob/main/changes/2024-10-12T09-11-16_1.12.0.md).

Thank you for your support! I hope you enjoy the new features as much as I enjoyed creating them.
