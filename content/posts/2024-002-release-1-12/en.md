I'm happy to announce the release of version 1.12 of Feeds Fun!

This release brings a lot of cool features and improvements.

**Because of a significant changes, all user settings are removed, including API keys**. You may want to review them.

First of all, interface and logic of collections of feeds are fully refactored. Using collections should be more convenient now:

- Your can subscribe for individual feeds from a collection or two a full collection.
- Feeds from collections will be marked in your feeds list.
- Each feed in collection accompanied by a detailed description.
- Of course, all **feeds in collections are tagged for free for all users**.

Old collections of feeds (gamedev, artificial intelligence) was removed, because their content was not good enough for our new collections standart. That is said, now we will form collections with more care and effort.

**And the first news collection is all scientific papers from arXiv!** So, now you can be always up to date with the latest scientific researches.

Secondly, but not less important, we added support for the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (Google's alternative to OpenAI ChatGPT). Now you can use for tagging not only OpenAI, but also Gemini. It is especially interesting because Gemini has a free tier for a limited number of requests => you can test full power of Feeds Fun without any additional costs.

You can set your OpenAI/Gemini API key in the settings section of the Feeds Fun website.

If your self-hosting Feeds Fun, see additional notes in [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Tiendil/feeds.fun/blob/main/changes/2024-10-12T09-11-16_1.12.0.md).
