**Feeds Fun 1.16** is on the prod!

This update brings fully reworked rules creation interface, a new collection, and a few other improvements.

## What's New

### Simplified rules creation

The old rules creation interface was confusing and, generally, not very friendly. It served us well the first year, but it is time to move on.

**The rules creation form was moved to the tags filter (from the entry tags list).**

- Now, you can see (filtered) news the new rule will score.
- Rules now support excluding tags. For example, you can create a rule that will not apply to news with the `science` tag.
- Tags under the news caption now behave as tags in the tags filter.

### News page interace improved

- Texts become bigger and more readable.
- Only a single news item body now can be opened simultaneously.
- Performance of the News page improved 2-3 times.
- Removed button to show all tags for the news item. Not, to see them, you can just open a news item body.

### Export your feeds to OPML file

On the feeds page, you can now export all your feeds to an OPML file. In case you want to move to another reader or just want to have a backup.

### New collection

New collections added for people interested in entrepreneurship & startups.

### Fixed Reddit feeds discovery

The new Reddit interface have no links to the news feeds. So, I added custome processing for URLs on `reddit.com` domains.
