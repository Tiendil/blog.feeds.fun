Tags are the real source of power in Feeds Fun. They allow you to rank, filter and sort news how you want, saving you time and energy.

Hovewer, tagging is not so simple as it seems. There is no strict definition of what a tag is, nor there is a standard for naming them.

We may agree, that tag is a some short string that describes the text or a part of it. But…

- How short it should be, is `this-text-is-about-modern-politics-in-the-central-asia` a tag or not?
- What about `politics` or `modern-politics` — are they different tags or the same?
- Which one of the tags `book-review`, `book-reviews`, `books-review`, `books-reviews` should we use?

There are numerous questions like that, and no clear answers.

The situsation even more complicated, because Feeds Fun uses different independent sources of tags, named `tag processors`, each of them may have its own rules and conventions for tags.
