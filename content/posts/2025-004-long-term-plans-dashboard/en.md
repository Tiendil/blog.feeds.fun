We prepared a [dashboard with long-term development plans](https://github.com/users/Tiendil/projects/1/views/1?pane=info).

We would greatly appreciate your feedback on it. React to the tasks you like:

- **Like** to increase the priority of the task.
- **Comment** to help us better understand your needs.
- **Create a feature request** if we missed something important for you.

All tasks are organized into four groups:

1. **Core Functionality** — must have — we consider these features the essence of the project — what
   the project is about.
2. **Key Features** — should have — these features are essential for the project, but not critical.
3. **Enhancements** — good to have — these features enhance the project, but we can live without them for a long time.
4. **Bonus Features** — nice to have — features that make the project better in some way, or features with unclear
   value for the project.

**We'll support PRs for any task from any group** — it will be a priority for us to review and merge them.

**We are open to discussion and suggestions** — the roadmap is not set in stone, we can change it according to community feedback and needs.
