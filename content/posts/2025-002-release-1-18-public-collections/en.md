**Feeds Fun 1.18** is live!

Our curated news collections became public — everyone can explore and share with friends the latest fully tagged news — no registration required.

Check them out here:

- [Scientific Papers](https://feeds.fun/show/scientific-papers) for latest research papers.
- [Entrepreneurship & Startups](https://feeds.fun/show/entrepreneurship) for the latest business insights.

Tags filter now reflected in the URL, so yor event can share subset of news, like [new machine learning papers](https://feeds.fun/show/scientific-papers/machine-learning) or [networking news](https://feeds.fun/show/entrepreneurship/networking).

Besides this, we made some other improvements:

- Improve the first load time of news list.
- If there's no recent news, Feeds Fun now loads older news to show that feeds are active.
