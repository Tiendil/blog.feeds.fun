**Feeds Fun 1.18** is live!

We are happy to announce that our curated news collections are now public. You and your friends can now access them without registration.

Check them out here:

- https://feeds.fun/show/scientific-papers for latest scientific papers
- https://feeds.fun/show/entrepreneurship for news about entrepreneurship and startups

You can even share links to a filtered news feed, like https://feeds.fun/show/scientific-papers/machine-learning to see only news about machine learning.

Besides this, we made some other improvements:

- Speed up the first loading of news list.
- If there is no news in the requested period, Feeds Fun will load some older news to show something to demonstrate that feeds are alive.
