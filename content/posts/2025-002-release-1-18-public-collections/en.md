**Feeds Fun 1.18** is live!

Curated news collections are now public — everyone can explore and share the latest fully tagged news with friends, no registration required.

Check them out here:

- [Scientific Papers](https://feeds.fun/show/scientific-papers) for latest research papers.
- [Entrepreneurship & Startups](https://feeds.fun/show/entrepreneurship) for the latest business insights.

Tag filters are now reflected in the URL, allowing you to easily share specific subsets of news, such as [new machine learning papers](https://feeds.fun/show/scientific-papers/machine-learning) or [professional networking news](https://feeds.fun/show/entrepreneurship/networking).

Besides this, we made some other improvements:

- Improved the initial loading time of news lists.
- If there's no recent news, Feeds Fun now loads older news to show that feeds are active.
