## Updates

**What improved for the users of [feeds.fun](https://feeds.fun)**:

- We introduced the [show tags]{post:take-control-of-the-number-of-tags-you-see} news filter option. It reduces the number of tags loaded from the server by excluding rare ones. By our measurements, it allows us to reduce the number of loaded tags up to 75% and the traffic up to 1.5 times!
- Feeds Fun now better parses OPML files produced by other RSS readers, which allows you to import your feeds from other readers more easily.

**What improved for our self-hosted users**:

- Improved processing of some Gemini API errors related to content policy violations.

This is a short recap; the complete detailed list of changes you may find in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Tiendil/feeds.fun/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
