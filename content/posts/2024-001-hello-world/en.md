Hello Everyone!

My name is Aliaksei, or [Tiendil](https://tiendil.org) on the web. This is the first post in the blog of my pet project [feeds.fun](https://feeds.fun).

Feeds Fun — is an [open source](https://github.com/Tiendil/feeds.fun) web based news reader specialized in organizing extensive streams of news content. Currently, by automatically assigning tags to news items and scoring them by rules you create. In the future, I'll research and implement more approaches.

I created the reader because I subscribe to a lot of news feeds (~500 at the moment) that generate 500-1000 news stories per day. It is impossible to read even all the titles in a reasonable time, and I did not find a satisfactory solution to organize this flow. So, I decided to create my own. The recent progress in neural networks and LLM, especially, was a great help in this.

How Feeds Fun works:

- You subscribe to news feeds: RSS, Atom, etc.
- Reader automatically assigns tags to each news item according to its content.
- You create rules to score news by tags.
- Filter and sort news how you want ⇒ read only what you want.

Feeds Fun helps me to save 4-8 hours per week, and I hope it will help you, too.

In this blog, I'll post documentation, news about significant project updates, best practices for using it, and other related topics.

So, subscribe to the RSS if you want to follow the news.
